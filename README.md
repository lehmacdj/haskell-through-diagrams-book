# Haskell Through Diagrams
This is a book that I am writing to teach Haskell to people with little to no
programming experience, with visualizations using the diagrams library.

The motivation for creating this book is almost entirely to teach my brother
Haskell.

You can read the book (in its current, unfinished state) at
[lehmacdj.github.io/haskell-through-diagrams-book][1].
