# Basic Diagrams

Let's draw some pretty pictures. After all this book is called **Haskell Through
Diagrams**.

`diagrams` is a Haskell library for drawing graphics.

Load up GHCi while in the project directory to have access to some of the
definitions that I provide for the more complex examples.

```
Î»> render "triangle" (triangle 1)
```

Open "diagrams/triangle.svg" and you should see a black triangle.
