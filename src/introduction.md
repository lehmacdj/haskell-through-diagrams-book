# Introduction
Welcome to Haskell through Diagrams! This is a book that teaches Haskell based
using visualizations, facilitated by the diagrams package.

## How to Read This Book
The book is presented mostly as a set of examples followed by a number of
exercises that either ask you to experiment using a particular set of functions
or to try to replicate a diagram I show you a picture of. I recommend reading
through the chapter and modifying parts of examples and trying them in GHCi in
order to get better at predicting what a particular piece of code will do. For
the code exercises, I include detailed solutions to all of them in the
complementary repository, however relying on the solution is only cheating your
self out of figuring out how to draw the diagram for yourself.

## Under Construction
This book is still under construction. Currently chapters 1-3 are mostly
finished, and chapter 4 has been started on. Please consider anything in this
book a work in progress to some extent.
