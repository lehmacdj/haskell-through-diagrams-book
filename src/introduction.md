# Introduction
Welcome to Haskell through Diagrams! This is a book that teaches Haskell based
using visualizations, facilitated by the diagrams package.

## How to Read This Book
The book is presented mostly as a set of examples followed by a number of
exercises that either ask you to experiment using a particular set of functions
or to try to replicate a diagram I show you a picture of. I recommend reading
through the chapter and modifying parts of examples and trying them in GHCi in
order to get better at predicting what a particular piece of code will do. For
the code exercises, I include detailed solutions to all of them in the
complementary repository, however relying on the solution is only cheating your
self out of figuring out how to draw the diagram for yourself.

Additionally, if you are ever are curious if something will work, try it! There
is no better way to learn than to experiment on your own and test your own
hypothesis (in my opinion). Additionally there is a lot of other great material
on Haskell out there, so if my explanation is not perfectly satisfactory you
should be able to look up most of the things using Google or
[haskell.org/hoogle](hasekll.org/hoogle). Some other great resources that might
complement this book well if you are inclined to use them are [the diagrams
tutorial](https://archives.haskell.org/projects.haskell.org/diagrams/doc/quickstart.html)
and [Learn You a Haskell for Great Good](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters).
There is significant overlap in the material from those resources and this one,
but sometimes a second perspective is extremely useful.

## Under Construction
This book is still under construction. Currently chapters 1-3 are mostly
finished, and chapter 4 has been started on. Please consider anything in this
book a work in progress to some extent.
